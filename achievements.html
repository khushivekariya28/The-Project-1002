              <p>Although the birth of the English novel is to be seen in the first half of the 18th century primarily in the work of Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Henry Fielding, it is with Jane Austen that the novel takes on its distinctively modern character in the realistic treatment of unremarkable people in the unremarkable situations of everyday life. In her six major novels—Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion—Austen created the comedy of manners of middle-class life in the England of her time, revealing the possibilities of “domestic” literature.  Her repeated fable of a young woman’s voyage to self-discovery on the passage through love to marriage focuses upon easily recognizable aspects of life. It is this concentration upon character and personality and upon the tensions between her heroines and their society that relates her novels more closely to the modern world than to the traditions of the 18th century.</p>

            <p>The enduring popularity of Austen’s books can be seen in the numerous film and television adaptions of her work. These include Ang Lee’s Sense and Sensibility (1995), which starred Emma Thompson (who also wrote the Academy Award-winning screenplay) and Kate Winslet. Pride and Prejudice was notably adapted into a 1940 movie starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier and a 1995 TV miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. Other film adaptations of Pride and Prejudice include Bride & Prejudice (2004), directed by Gurinder Chadha and starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan; a 2005 film featuring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen; and Fire Island (2022), starring Joel Kim Booster. Mansfield Park was covered in a 1983 miniseries, a 1999 film, and a 2007 TV movie. Treatments of Emma include a 1996 TV movie, a 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and a 2020 movie. In addition, Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) was based on Pride and Prejudice, and Clueless (1995) was inspired by Emma.</p>

            <p>It is this modernity, together with the wit, realism, and timelessness of her prose style, her shrewd, amused sympathy, and the satisfaction to be found in stories so skillfully told, in novels so beautifully constructed, that helps to explain her continuing appeal for readers of all kinds. Modern critics remain fascinated by the commanding structure and organization of the novels, by the triumphs of technique that enable the writer to lay bare the tragicomedy of existence in stories of which the events and settings are apparently so ordinary and so circumscribed.</p>
